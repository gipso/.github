## Hi there 👋

![A photo of the GIPSO's project "Durma na EACH"](profile/images/cover.jpg)

We are a research group based at the University of Sao Paulo ([USP](http://usp.br/)) dedicated to studying life from the perspective of time, which includes the study of sleep and biological rhythms. Our group is composed of hospitable and irreverent researchers, from different areas of knowledge, who value interdisciplinarity and horizontality in the discussion and development of science.

You can get to know us better at [each.usp.br/gipso](http://each.usp.br/gipso).
