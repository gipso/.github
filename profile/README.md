## Hi there üëã

We are a scientific research group dedicated to studying the temporal aspect of life (üå±‚è≥), which includes the study of sleep and other biological rhythms. Our team is composed of welcoming  researchers, from different areas of knowledge, who value interdisciplinarity and horizontality in the discussion and development of science.

Get to know us better at [each.usp.br/gipso](http://each.usp.br/gipso).
